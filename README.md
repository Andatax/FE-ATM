## Learning Process

- I had the oportunity to learn how to use React integrated reducers and pass my global state as Provider for my application.

- The application ressembles the mockup provided, however the functionality of the application it is not as expected.

- I was not able to implement update correctly my local state in my Screen component in order to render different screens whevener a user clicks on the buttons.

- In order to change the global state LoggedIn it has to be set true or false manually inside the App component.

- Debugging these errors would have took me a bit more time than expected and I was not able to match the deadline. 

- I had the oportunity to practice more how to properly type react components when coding in typescript.

- I used Chrome to test my application, on a 16:9 ratio monitor, 1920x1080 screen resolution and I was able to run my application in the browser on my computer.

- I would like to thank whoever reviews my application for the time it may take and for your patience.

- I would like to thank in case there is any provided feedback regarding this technical test, in case there is any, it will be highly appreciated and implemented in the future.

- I would like to thank the developers for desiging this test to check my react skills.
